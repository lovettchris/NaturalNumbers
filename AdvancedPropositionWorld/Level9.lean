# Advanced proposition world.

You already know enough to embark on advanced addition world. But here are just a couple
more things.

## Level 9: `exfalso` and proof by contradiction.

It's certainly true that `P ∧ (¬ P) ⟹ Q` for any propositions `P`
and `Q`, because the left hand side of the implication is false. But how do
we prove that `false` implies any proposition `Q`? A cheap way of doing it in
Lean is using the `exfalso` tactic, which changes any goal at all to `false`.
You might think this is a step backwards, but if you have a hypothesis `h : ¬ P`
then after `rw not_iff_imp_false at h,` you can `apply h,` to make progress.
Try solving this level without using `cc` or `tauto`, but using `exfalso` instead.

## Lemma
If `P` and `Q` are true/false statements, then `(P ∧ (¬ P)) ⟹ Q.`

## Pro tip.

`¬ P` is actually `P → false` *by definition*. Try
commenting out `rw [not_iff_imp_false] at ...` by putting two minus signs `--`
before the `rw`. Does it still compile?

## Tactic : exfalso

## Summary

`exfalso` changes your goal to `False`.

## Details

We know that `False` implies `P` for any proposition `P`, and so if your goal is `P`
then you should be able to `apply` `False → P` and reduce your goal to `False`. This
is what the `exfalso` tactic does. The theorem that `False → P` is called `false.elim`
so one can achieve the same effect with `apply False.elim`.

This tactic can be used in a proof by contradiction, where the hypotheses are enough
to deduce a contradiction and the goal happens to be some random statement (possibly
a False one) which you just want to simplify to `False`.
